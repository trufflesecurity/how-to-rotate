Welcome to [**How To Rotate**](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/how-to-rotate), an open-source collection of API Key Rotation tutorials. Each tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to remediate a leaked API key security vulnerability by (1) Generating a new API key, (2) Replacing the compromised key, and (3) Revoking the compromised key.

To get started, click on a key rotation tutorial for a specific SaaS provider below or [read more about key rotation](/docs/introduction/key-rotation-101.md).
